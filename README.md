This project uses nlp to compare four text files and find out if one of the first three authors wrote the fourth
It does this by cleaning the texts, breaking them into trigrams (groups of three words), and finding the most common ones
The fourth text is compared to the others by checking shared trigrams. The text with the most overlaps is likely written by the same author and a bar chart shows the results visually
